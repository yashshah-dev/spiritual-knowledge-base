Everyone experiences situations where they vow to avoid repeating errors yet end up making the same mistakes. The cycle of repeating mistakes appears endless when we fall for unsuitable partners or postpone work until deadlines become overwhelming or when we lose control of our emotions. But why do we keep making the same mistakes? The Bhagavad Gita, a 5,000-year-old spiritual dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna, offers a piercing psychological and spiritual explanation. Your untrained mind together with past karma and ego operate like disguises while fate plays no role in your repeated mistakes.

Everyone experiences the situation of repeating their errors despite making firm resolutions to avoid them. The situation creates intense frustration. The issue might extend beyond human willpower or personal limitations. What if the problem stems from something fundamental that exists within the spiritual realm? The Bhagavad Gita presents a dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna which provides explanations for our repetitive patterns and techniques to achieve liberation from them.Your Mistakes Are Not Accidents—They’re PatternsYour Mistakes Are Not Accidents—They’re Patterns(Image credit :Freepik)Have you ever caught yourself saying, “I knew better, but I did it again”? That’s not weakness—it’s wiring. The Bhagavad Gita explains this through the idea of samskaras—mental impressions left by past actions.Krishna says in Chapter 6, Verse 5: One must uplift oneself by one’s own mind. Do not let the self be degraded.” Each time you repeat a thought or behavior—like procrastinating, reacting in anger, or falling into self-doubt, you deepen that groove in your mind. Over time, this becomes your default response. Modern neuroscience echoes this: around 95% of your actions are driven by your subconscious mind, according to the National Science Foundation. So, when you keep slipping into the same mistake, your mind isn’t failing—it’s following old instructions.You're Not Lazy or Angry—You're Influenced by Rajas and TamasYour Mistakes Are Not Accidents—They’re Patterns(Image credit :Freepik)The Gita teaches that all human behavior is governed by three gunas or energies: Sattva (clarity, harmony), Rajas (restlessness, desire)and Tamas (inertia, ignorance).  When Rajas dominates, you act out of impulse and overdrive. When Tamas rules, you delay, avoid, or numb out. Mistakes tend to happen when we’re stuck in these two modes.Think about itYou lash out, then regret it? That’s Rajas. You shut down and avoid action? That’s Tamas.Krishna’s solution is not punishment—it’s purification. He encourages you to cultivate Sattva—through calm, discipline, and conscious effort. And there’s science behind it: A Harvard study found that decisions made in emotionally charged states are wrong 76% of the time.Ego Makes You Repeat What You Know Is WrongIn Chapter 3, Verse 27, Krishna states: All actions are performed by the modes of nature. But the one who is deluded by ego thinks, ‘I am the doer.’Here’s the trap: You think you’re in control, but really, your ego is running the show.  The ego loves to defend your flaws. This is just who I am, I always mess things up. and People like me never change. These aren’t truths. They’re excuses—built by the ego to avoid discomfort and growth.Psychologists call this labeling bias—when you define yourself by your errors, you unknowingly invite them back in. The Gita tells you to stop clinging to this false identity. You’re not your past. You’re not your pain. You’re the witness—and you can rewrite the script.Karma Is a Cycle—But You Can Break ItKarma(Image credit :Freepik)Karma is often misunderstood. It’s not punishment for something you did in a past life—it’s the momentum of your current behavior. Every time you repeat a mistake, you reinforce a karmic loop. It’s not fate, it’s familiarity. And until you become conscious of it, your mind will choose the familiar over the right. Breaking the cycle starts with one decision: Stop reacting. Start observing.The Gita’s Tools to Stop Repeating the Same MistakesThe Gita doesn’t just tell you what’s wrong—it shows you how to healTrain the MindIn Chapter 6, Verse 26, Krishna says: “Whenever the mind wanders, bring it back under the control of the Self.” This is mindfulness—pure and simple.
