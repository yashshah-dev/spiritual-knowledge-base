While women are often seen at the forefront of Sawan fasting and rituals, men's participation is less visible but no less meaningful. This article explores how devotion during the sacred month of Sawan transcends gender roles, reflecting on traditions, evolving practices, and why true bhakti belongs to the soul not just a social script.

Every year, as the rain clouds arrive and the lunar month of Sawan (Shravan) begins, a spiritual energy takes over in India. Temples dedicated to Lord Shiva overflow with worshippers. The market fills with green bangles, mehendi, and traditional sweets. Social media fills with images of women in green skirts to honor Somvar vrat (Monday fasting), showing prayers and rituals. But there is one question that murmering underneath: Where are the men? Do men participate in Sawan like women do? Or, has this month of deep spirituality become so steeped in practice, that it is largely gendered? Let’s examine the many layers of devotion, social roles, and spiritual equality in relation to Sawan.1. The Feminine Face of SawanSawan puja(Image credit :MyLifeXP)Traditionally, women especially those who are unmarried or married are the most visible participants in Sawan rituals. They observe fasts on Mondays, visit Shiva temples, and perform pujas, all in hopes of finding a good husband or ensuring the long life of the one they already have. This cultural narrative is deeply intertwined with the symbolism of Shiva and Parvati, where Parvati’s unwavering devotion ultimately wins Shiva as her husband. Each year, women reenact this myth through their fasting (or vrat), aspiring to embody the goddess’s dedication and receive divine blessings in their relationships. This poignant love story has made Sawan a deeply emotional and personal experience for women. It’s not just a ritual; it’s a heartfelt prayer and a poetic act of surrender.2. Where Are the Men?sawan(Image credit :Freepik)Now, it’s not to say that men are completely absent from Sawan. In fact, during the Kawad Yatra, men—known as Kanwariyas—carry water from the Ganga and trek miles barefoot to offer it at Shiva temples. This is regarded as one of the most intense and physically demanding expressions of devotion during Sawan. However, unlike the women’s Sawan vrat, men’s devotion tends to manifest in a more external, action-oriented way. It’s about penance, pilgrimage, and showcasing physical strength. The emotional, intimate, and home-centered spirituality that women express through fasting, rituals, and quiet prayers is less frequently observed in men during this month.So, is there a divide here? Or is it simply a difference in how devotion is expressed?3. Bhakti Has No Gendershiva parvati(Image credit :Pixabay)In Hinduism, particularly in the path of bhakti (devotion), love for God isn’t confined by gender. Lord Rama had male devotees like Hanuman, while Krishna was adored by female devotees like Mirabai. Shiva himself embodies Ardhanarishwara half male, half femalesymbolizing the complete union of energies. With that perspective, Sawan isn’t just a “women’s month” or a “men’s ritual.” It’s a spiritual opportunity available to anyone seeking inner purification, surrender, and a connection with the divine. The realIt’s Not About Roles, It’s About RealizationSawan isn't only about who observes a fast, who prepares the meal, or who wears green. It is about who seeks, who surrenders, and who shows up to the divine with a heart of sincerity. Shiva does not care if it is sindoor or silence, a bouquet of flowers, or a planned day of fasting, the only question he has is - Are you ready to let go of your ego and return home to the divine?Unlock insightful tips and inspiration on personal growth, productivity, and well-being.
