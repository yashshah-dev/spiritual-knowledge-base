You’ve been taught to care for your body, shape it, style it, and present it to the world. But what if everything you think you are — your face, your gender, your age, your pain — is not really you? In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna offers a radical message: you are not this body, this name, or this story. You are something far deeper, untouched by time or death. This article unpacks that truth — and what it means in a world obsessed with identity.

Look at your own reflection in the mirror : that face, those eyes, that skin, that shape - that is what the world sees and what you identify as you. That is how you see and locate yourself, that is how others identify you, and that is how you move through your day-to-day life. But what if none of it is you? In the Bhagavad Gita, when Krishna says this, it is not just a suggestion or friendly spiritual metaphor, it is a bold challenge to all that you think of as yourself. You are not your body, and you are not even your mind. You are the unchanging witness behind it all. And once you get this, all of its manifestations - fear, death, and your ego - begin to unravel.The Body: A Beautiful DisguiseThe Body: A Beautiful Disguise(Image credit :Freepik)In Chapter 2 of the Gita, when Arjuna becomes bogged down by grief and refuses to fight, Krishna delivers a line that stops time- "As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul similarly accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and worn-out bodies." (Gita 2.22) To Krishna, the body is an outfit — essential for the journey, but not the traveler. Just think about that: Your injuries are not you. Your sex is not permanent, Your youth, your wrinkles and your scars — none of it is you. This is not denial. It is freedom.Because when you cease to overly identify with the temporary, you touch the eternal witness that lays behind it.So Then — Who Are You ReallySo Then — Who Are You Really(Image credit :Freepik)You are Atman pure, indestructible consciousness. You were never born. You will never die. You were never harmed. You will never break. The Gita says: “The soul is neither born, nor does it ever die ... it does not perish when the body is destroyed.” (Gita 2.20) This is not to suggest that we deny the body — we just don’t want to mistake the vehicle for the driver. When you see this clearly you move through life with more grace and less fear, and a natural release of grasping what we all must lose.

But the Gita flips the question. It’s not “Who are you becoming? It’s “Who is watching all of this unfold?” Krishna isn’t asking you to deny your personality or life story. He’s inviting you to detach from the illusion that it defines your worth.
