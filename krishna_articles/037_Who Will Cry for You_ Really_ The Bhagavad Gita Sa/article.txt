We spend so much of our lives trying to matter—to be seen, to be loved, to be remembered. Some of us even imagine our own funeral: Who will cry? Who will regret how they treated us? Who will miss us the most? But underneath that question is something far deeper and far more spiritual. This article explores that hidden longing—not through pop psychology, but through the profound wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita. What if the tears of others were never the point? What if the real journey was inward all along?
